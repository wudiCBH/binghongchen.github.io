## About Me

I am a currently a master student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, beginning in Fall 2025. I believe robot learning is the future and I want to do research or projects about robot learning, especially manipulation. 

Prior to CMU, I received my B.S. degree in Agricultural Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2025. At Zhejiang University, I worked on soft magnetic robot supervised by prof.Mingchuan Zhou. I also participated in a summer research internship about fault tolerant control of quadrotor in Arclab, the University of Hong Kong, supervised by prof.Peng Lu. In addition, I spent several months for internship in Dessight Biomedical Company focusing on da Vinci Research Kit.

I am seeking a research advisor right now. I will also apply for Ph.D. in robotics upon 2027 fall. Although this website is quite empty for now, I look forward to filling it with meaningful research and projects in the coming years.
